ANYTIME. ANYWHERE. 5 PREFACE VSight Remote is a platform that connects experts with the point of service to solve problems remotely. Via an adaptive audio and video stream, the expert can participate on the live events on site. Users can place annotations on the live stream, on frozen images, or on shared files. Furthermore, by using augmented reality (AR) tools and integrating 3D objects, expert knowledge can be made available to the service technician on site. Anytime. Anywhere. A welcome side effect is that needless travel can be avoided, travel restrictions can be circumvented, and various problems can be solved faster, more efficiently and with less cost thanks to VSight. This manual explains all the key features of the VSight Remote web interface, so you can easily find your way around and take full advantage of the application. In addition, you will find information on supported devices and file types, data consumption, required port settings, and network requirements for a smooth use of the VSight Remote Platform.

ROOMS Besides calls and scheduled meetings, permanent rooms are a way to start VSight Remote Sessions. For example, with longer commissioning projects, you might want to hold a session every day without having to schedule a meeting with the users every time. Admins or coadmins can grant access and assign users to individual rooms. Some customers of VSight also use the room functionality to set up rooms for certain key customers branded with their logo, so that they feel particularly valued. For a detailed outline of all rooms assigned to you, please click on the \'93Rooms\'94 button in the main menu. Fig. 7: List of all rooms 1 2 3 4 REMOTE COLLABORATION. ANYTIME. ANYWHERE. 11 Each room is displayed with its specific room name u, the description v and the names of all other users assigned to this room. Users, whose names are shown in green, already joined the room \u142 . Upon clicking \'93JOIN\'94 \u143 , you will enter the room and join the session. For further information on sessions, please refer to chapter 8. Please note that only your admin and co-admins are entitled to created or delete rooms and to grant access to individual users. 5.1 Auto-join room To make usage of VSight easier for users, you can assign them to a default room. This means that upon logging in or opening the app, user will be automatically redirected to their assigned room. User can use other functionalities once they leave the session. Please note that only your admin and co-admins are entitled assign rooms to individual users. To use this feature, you should contact your account administrator. 6. MEETINGS Meetings are particularly suitable for planning sessions with date and time in the future and inviting users to them. The users, in turn, can save the calendar invitation, are reminded of the session beforehand and can join simply via a link. A simple and pleasant way of use, especially for external users outside your company. VSight customers appreciate this function, e.g., for planned maintenance or for sessions to be carried out later that do not have to take place urgently. Click on the "Meetings" button in the main menu to see the detailed view of all your meetings. REMOTE COLLABORATION. ANYTIME. ANYWHERE. 12 Fig. 8: List of all meetings Here you will find an overview of all upcoming meetings u, as well as previous, or already started meetings v. Each meeting is displayed with the scheduled time and duration \u142 , and the users involved \u143 .

ANYTIME. ANYWHERE. 13 6.1 Schedule meetings All users who use VSight Remote with an expert license are entitled to schedule sessions in advance. These so-called meetings can be created via the green "Schedule a meeting" button, located both in the lobby (Fig. 6, upper right corner), and in the meeting menu (Fig. 8). Thereafter, the following pop-up window appears: Fig. 9: Schedule a meeting Every meeting requires a title u. Select from the dropdown menu which users are supposed to join the meeting v. Schedule a date \u142  and time \u143  for the meeting. The duration of the meeting will then be displayed in addition \u144 .

In addition, you can also invite further participants and guests by entering their email addresses in the designated field \u145 . To add several email addresses, please hit the Enter key after each address. If you also want to invite additional participants, you can share the access link later, as shown in Fig. 8. Finally, click \'93Schedule\'94 to successfully create this meeting. It will thereafter appear in the overview of your upcoming meetings (see Fig. 8). 1 2 3 4 5 6 REMOTE COLLABORATION. ANYTIME. ANYWHERE. 14 Please note that the meeting function is only available for PRO and ULTIMATE licenses, or can be restricted by your admin. 7. USERS 7.1 Different roles of users ADMIN: Each account is assigned one admin. Only the administrator and so-called co-admins have access to the admin panel where they manage the account. The administrator creates and configures both users and rooms, he grants all permissions and has control over all settings and the recordings, which are stored in the admin panel. There is no option to delete an administrator, not even in the admin panel. CO-ADMIN: In case the administrator wants to entrust other users with the exclusive administrator rights, he can create co-admins. Co-admins have the same permissions and rights as administrators. The only difference between administrators and co-admins is that co-admins cannot delete the administrator, vice versa it is possible though. An unlimited number of co-admins can be created per account. Co-admins who use the VSight platform as a user, automatically take on the role of a subscriber. If the co-admin is supposed to take on the role of an expert, VSight can create this dual role. Please contact your contact person at VSight. EXPERTS: Experts are usually the users who guide the subscribers on site remotely. A session is only started as soon as an expert enters the room. In the academy room, this function is performed by the appointed host, who needs to actively start the session. SUBSCRIBERS: Subscribers are the users who receive the support and guidance of experts from afar, such as service technicians or end customers on site. Subscribers and experts have the same permissions and features. The only difference is that only experts can start a session. This is due to the VSight licensing model, where all subscribers can use the platform for free. REMOTE COLLABORATION. ANYTIME. ANYWHERE. 15 7.2 Call function between users Vsight Remote sessions can also be started via a call. This function is particularly used by our customers internally. For example, you can quickly contact the user in the field. Another case study would be a user in the field who, after certain work steps, would like to call the expert in the "back office" again. The constant planning of meetings or arranging the time when to meet in the room is no longer necessary - you just call each other. To be able to receive calls, you must of course be logged in to the web interface. For you to be able to make calls, the user you are calling must be logged in to the web interface or the Android/iOS app. The user does not have to have the Android/iOS app actively open but should be logged in so that he can receive the call on the logged-in device. If your admin authorized you to access the list of all other users, you can see the details in the submenu \'93Users\'94. Fig. 10: List of all users with search and call function Via the integrated search bar, you can quickly and easily search for specific users by their name u. You can also use the role filter to display only users with a specific role v. To call a user from this list, simply click on the respective green phone icon \u142 . To start a group call with multiple users, first click on \'93Select multiple\'94 \u143  and activate the check boxes of the users you want to call \u144 . The call is set up as soon as you click \'93Call\'94 \u145 . Once your call is accepted, a VSight Remote session will be started in your so-called personal meeting room. 1 2 3 4 5 6 REMOTE COLLABORATION. ANYTIME. ANYWHERE. 16 Fig. 11: Incoming call As soon as you receive a call, it will be displayed in the lobby under the heading "Ongoing calls" u. You will also receive a pop-up notification where you can accept v or deny \u142  the call. Alternatively, you can also accept the call and enter the session via the "JOIN" \u143  button. Please note that the call function is only available for PRO and ULTIMATE licenses, or can be restricted by your admin. 8. SESSION VSight Remote offers several ways to start a session. Joining a room is probably the most common one. In case you want to schedule a session in advance, you can do this via \'93Meetings\'94 (see chapter 6.1). To start a session spontaneously, you can call other users of your account and instantly initiate a session (see chapter 7.2). In addition, external users can be added to a session via a guest access in the form of a link or a QR code (for more information see chapter 8.4.1). No matter which of these different options you choose, you will always end up in a typical VSight Remote Session. Its user interface and features are explained in more detail below. Due to the VSight licensing model, at least one expert must be present to start a session. 8.1 Join a session Whether you're joining a room, attending a meeting, or accepting a call, you'll always end up in a VSight Remote Session. 1 2 3 4 REMOTE COLLABORATION. ANYTIME. ANYWHERE. 17 Initially, you will be asked to allow the application access to your camera and microphone. VSight Remote requires this approval regardless of whether you switch your camera & microphone on or off during the session. If you do not want to issue consent at each session, you can ask the browser to remember your decision u. Then click on "Allow" v to grant access to the application. By clicking on the camera \u142  and microphone icon \u143 , you can control whether they are active or inactive when entering the session. Fig. 12: Grant access to camera and microphone before joining the session In the settings \u144  you can choose between available cameras and microphones. Ultimately, click on "JOIN" \u145  to enter the room and thus the session. Please note that your camera/microphone must not be used by another application at the same time (e.g., during a Teams meeting). 8.2 User Tutorial For all new users, a tutorial is displayed that guides you through the platform and provides a step-by-step introduction of the main features u. 1 2 3 4 5 6 REMOTE COLLABORATION. ANYTIME. ANYWHERE. 18 Fig. 13: User Tutorial In case you do not want to see the tutorial anymore, click on "Do not show again". To start the actual session, you need to close the tutorial \u9633 . You can at any time go back to the tutorial via the \'93Show User Tutorial" button in the side menu (see Fig. 15 v). 8.3 User interface The user interface of the VSight Remote Session in the web application, shown in Fig. 14, is identical, no matter whether you start the session via a call, a meeting, or a room.

To change your audio/video source during the session, select your favored microphone or camera from the drop-down menu next to the respective icon. If your internet quality allows, your administrator can upgrade the video quality even to FullHD. Please note that your internet connection affects the video stream. If your connection quality is not suitable for video conferencing, your video stream will automatically stop and switch to audio-only mode. In consequence, all other users will only hear you, but cannot see your video stream. This will not interrupt the session. For more information regarding the network requirements, see chapter 12. Please note that Full HD video is a setting controlled by your admin. \u143  Leave session: To leave the session, please click on the red phone icon. \u144  Record session: Your admin can grant individual users the permission to start or stop recording a session. In addition, your admin can set the automatic recording of all sessions in certain rooms. The admin can also decide whether the approval of all users shall be obtained before a recording can be started. This consent is also required from participants who have joined the session at a later stage. To record a session manually, please click on the "Record" icon. A second click will stop the recording. Every recording is automatically stored in the admin panel. If you have purchased the add-on function "Session export", you can receive the download link for all the recording as well as all contents of the session by email (see chapter 8.8). Please note that the recording function is only included in ULTIMATE licenses. Please contact your admin or approach us via info@vsight.io. \u145  Share screen: REMOTE COLLABORATION. ANYTIME.

Your chosen reaction, together with your name, will be displayed to all users in the main video stream for about 2 seconds. This function allows for non-verbal communication, e.g., in very noisy environments. Side menu: This button is used to collapse or expand the side menu. 8.4 Side menu The side menu consists of the four columns: "Chat", "Participants", "Files" and "Settings".

ANYWHERE. 21 CHAT: Upmost you find the possibility to watch the user tutorial again v. The chat section is used for written communication and collaboration. In addition, the chat window serves as kind of a transcript of the session, as it logs all actions, shared documents and messages including their translation \u142 . You can use the paper clip icon \u143  to upload files, to share them with other users or to collaborate on them. You can also simply drag & drop files into the chat window. For more information how to collaborate on documents, see chapter 8.7. To enter text messages, please use the designated field. For more info on the chat function with integrated translation, see chapter 8.4.2. PARTICIPANTS: All users assigned to the room are being displayed in this section. Those, who already joined the session, are marked in green. FILES: Our new file section can be used by all experts and co-admins. Upload your files before a session starts \u145 , select which files shall be used and accessed in the session or download data from the files section \u146 . Pictures or documents from the session can also be archived in the files section. All files stored in the section will stay there until you actively delete them .

You can also manually download the QR code with a right click. Please note that sharing via SMS is a paid add-on feature. Please contact your administrator in this regard. 8.4.2 Connect to mobile Users via the Field ID In case you want to provide remote support to external users or end customers without VSight login credentials, our Field ID is the easiest and fastest way to connect. Fig. 16: Connect to external Users via the Field ID Code Once you started a session, please enter the 6-digit ID code, which is displayed on the login interface of the mobile VSight Remote app u, into the designated field in the settings section v.

To overcome language barriers, VSight Remote provides an instant translation function. Once you specified the target language of incoming and outgoing messages in the settings (see Fig. 15 & ), the system translates all messages automatically.

ADD-ON FUNCTION ACADEMY ROOM In an academy room, you can conduct sessions with up to 112 participants, e.g., for training purposes on a larger scale. There are 3 different roles in an academy room: HOST: (1 User) ... is appointed by the admin and has the permission to start and manage the session. He controls or moderates the action by allowing participants, for instance when questions arise (hand signal), to share their audio and video stream. PUBLISHER: (up to 12 users) ... are the participants who have been authorized by the host to share their audio and video streams during the session. ADDITIONAL PARTICIPANTS: (up to 100 users) ... are the participants who join and follow the session but are not per se allowed to share their audio/videostream. REMOTE COLLABORATION. ANYTIME. ANYWHERE. 42 Fig. 31: Academy room A session in the academy room must be started by the host. At the beginning, the host can allow certain participants to share their audio/video stream during the session, thus appointing them as publishers u. This always requires the consent of the publishers. All other participants can follow the session with their microphone/camera deactivated. In case of a question, participants can raise their hand v. The host gets notified \u142  and he can activate the audio/video stream of the participant \u143  so that he can publicly ask the question. Alternatively, he can also reject the question by clicking on the hand symbol. To reject all messages at once, simply click on the \'93LOWER ALL HANDS\'94 button \u144 . A maximum of 12 audio/video streams can be published simultaneously. The roles of the publishers can change during a session. By clicking on the pin needle \u145  of any window, the host can fix this window in the center and thus controls the view for all users. All other publishers are displayed on the left side of the screen. Please note that the academy room license is an add-on that is not included in your license and needs to be purchased extra.
